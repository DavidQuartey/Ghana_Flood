Ghana has always been getting flooded, but it seems that only floods in Accra are getting attention. I wrote about it [here](https://medium.com/@DaveQuartey/like-accra-other-places-are-being-flooded-where-e1c67b90d5b7), and the key visualization was an animated map showing the floods in Ghana, and built in R. In this post, I document how I did it, hopefully you can do one also!

 Before we start, there are a number of things we will need:
 
 + Flooding data
 + Packages
 

Lets load the R packages we will need:
```
library(ggmap)
library(ggplot2)
library(gganimate)
```
`ggmap` is what we will use to pull the Ghana Map from google.
`ggplot2` to plot the points and `gganimate` to animate.

### Data
[Green Ghanaian](http://greenghanaian.org/blog-details.php?id=44) did an amazing job of putting together a Ghana Flood League Table so I placed it in a `.csv` file [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavidQuartey/Ghana_Flood/master/ghanafloods_data.csv).

Download it and lets get our hands dirty.

We will import the .csv file into R using the `read.csv()` function.

```{r import_data}
g <- read.csv("ghanafloods_data.csv")
```
What this does is, it pulls the data from the location stated into R.

```{r see_data}
head(g)
```

We then convert the date in the data to an R recognizable format:
```{r convert_date}
g$date <- as.Date(g$date, format = "%d/%m/%Y")
head(g)
```

Order or arrange the flood data through its date.
```{r arrange_date}
g <- g[order(g$date),]
head(g)
```

### Ghana Map
We'll use the `ggmap` library to pull the Ghana map into R. 
First, lets load the `ggmap` package into our workspace together with the `ggplot2` package because ggmap depends on it.

```
library(ggplot2)
library(ggmap)
```

We now import the Ghana map using the `get_map()` function and wrap it in `ggmap()` to plot.

```{r get_map}
p <- ggmap(get_map("Ghana", zoom = 7))
print(p)
```

In `get_map()`, we set the argument location as "Ghana" and zoom in or out of that specified location with zoom argument. `zoom = 7` works fine. You can play around with it using numbers ranging from 3(zoomout) to 21(zoomin).

### Plot!
Now that we have our Ghana Map in R, it's time to plot!

We want to plot the *points* on the map. This can be done using `geom_point()`. The x axis becomes the longitude and the y axis becomes the latitube.
```{r plot_point1}
p + geom_point(data = g, aes(x = lon, y = lat))
```

We could color the points using the `col` argument in the aesthetics function, with the `scale_color_manual()` used to override the default point color or to change the colour.
```{r plot_point2}
p + geom_point(data = g, aes(x = lon, y = lat, col = Legend)) + 
scale_color_manual(values ="red1")
```

We could further increase the point size.
```{r plot_point3}
p + geom_point(data = g, aes(x = lon, y = lat, col = Legend), size = 7) + scale_color_manual(values ="red1")
```

We then make the points a little more transparent by assigning it with an alpha value. This is done to make it visible when points overlap. `alpha = 0.3` works fine here.
```{r plot_point4}
p + geom_point(data = g, aes(x = lon, y = lat, col = Legend), size = 7, alpha = 0.3) + scale_color_manual(values ="red1")
```

A title is needed. 
```{r plot_point5}
p + geom_point(data = g, aes(x = lon, y = lat, col = Legend), size = 7, alpha = 0.3) + scale_color_manual(values ="red1") + labs(title = "Ghana Floods from March, 2016 - July, 2016 \n")
```

### Lets do some Animation, shall we?
Before we start we'll need to have either [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/) or [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) installed for animations.

Regardless of the one you choose to install, make sure it is in your PATH so that you don't run into problems when using it in R.

Also we would need to insert the `cumulative` and `frame` arguments in our plot aethetics.
Our arguments are `cumulative` = TRUE which will allows R to biuld up on the points it plots. 
`frame = date` tells R to change the animation frame by the date column, thats why it's important to change the date to an R-readable format here.
```{r plot_point6}
p <- p + geom_point(data = g, aes(x = lon, y = lat, frame = date, col = Legend,
                                  cumulative = TRUE), size = 7, alpha = 0.3) + scale_color_manual(values ="red1") + labs(title = "Ghana Floods from March, 2016 - July, 2016 \n")
```


```
#convert = "im convert" if using ImageMagick or convert = "gm convert" if using GraphicMagick
gg_animate(p, outfile = "outfile.gif", convert = "gm convert", ani.width = 700, title_frame = TRUE)
```

And viola!
